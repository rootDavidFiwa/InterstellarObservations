 intob.101.desc:0 "After realizing that there are ways to chart new hyperlanes to yet unreachable systems, our scientists got to work. With the help of the ancient artifacts, they managed to devise a method that for now allows us to detect ancient hyperlanes to lost stars. These haven't been used for millions of years, so we will need to construct an Interstellar Oberservation Post on one of our Starbases to allow us to travel them safely. "
