 intob.101.desc:0 "After realizing that there are ways to chart new hyperlanes to yet unreachable systems, our scientists got to work.

These haven't been used for millions of years, so we will need to construct an Interstellar Oberservation Post on one of our Starbases to allow us to travel them safely. "
